This is the project repository for a project in Software Engineering at Dalhousie
University.

This application uses the Meteor with Node.js, MongoDB and HTML5.

It has Risk style gameplay and revolves around Cidital Hill in Halifax. Players join the game via a webpage and choose a side to fight
for around the Cidital. Players command an army and go to designated battle zones to
attack the other players. They contribute to the battle by going into different zones, which increases
the soldier attack multiplier for that zone. They can then temporarily take control of that zone and move
onto another zone.
